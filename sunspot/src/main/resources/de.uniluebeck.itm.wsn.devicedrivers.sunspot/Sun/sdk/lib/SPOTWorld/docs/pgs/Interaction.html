            running. </p>

            <p>This menu option brings up a panel where the user can choose
            which application (if any) to run in the <a
            href="Terminology.html#MainIsolate">main isolate</a>. Only one
            application may run in the main isolate and the SPOT must be reset
            for this change to take effect. After the reset, the only
            application running on the SPOT would be the chosen one, all other
            previously running applications will be terminated. <br />

            Sun SPOT. The following dialog box will display:<br />

            height="auto" width="550" border="0" /> </center>
            <p>By default, the project directory will be cleaned, all source
            code will be recompiled and the resulting <a
            href="Terminology.html#suite">suite</a> will be installed on the
            SPOT. The clean and compile steps may be skipped by unchecking the
            appropriate boxes. This might make sense, for example, if the
            application suite was created recently and the same suite is being
            deployed on multiple SPOTs. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Undeploy</b> 
            <p>This menu option brings up a sub-menu listing all installed
            suites and selecting any suite on this list will unload it from the
            SPOT. The command will fail if the suite is in use, <i>e.g.</i>,
            one of the applications in the suite is currently active. If a
            suite includes <a
            href="Terminology.html#MultipleApplications">multiple
            applications</a>, all of them will be unloaded together. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Deploy library ...</b> 
            <p>Downloads to the SPOT a fresh copy of the current library (as
            specified by the <tt>spot.library.name</tt> property in the
            <tt>.sunspot.properties</tt> file in the user's home directory) on
            to the SPOTin the active SDK. After the library is installed, the
            SPOT will be reset and all previously running applications
            terminated. </p>
            <p>This command is useful, for example, when a user has created a
            new library using the <tt>ant library</tt> command. Refer to the
            <i>Sun SPOT Developer's Guide</i> for details on how to rebuild the
            library. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Synchronize SDK ...</b> 
            <p>Downloads system software from the Sun SPOT SDK currently active
            on the host (where Solarium is running) to the selected SPOT. This
            option is only enabled for USB-connected SPOTs. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Blink LEDs</b> 
            <p>Causes the SPOT to blink its LEDs. This command is useful for
            locating the physical SPOT corresponding to the SPOT on display.
            </p>
            <p>On SPOTs equipped with the eDemo sensor board, all of its eight
            tricolor LEDs as well as the Activity LED on the main board are
            flashed. If a SPOT does not have the eDemo sensor board installed,
            only the activity LED is flashed. Refer to the <i>Sun SPOT Owner's
            Manual</i> for the location of the Activity LED. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Get Info</b> 
            <p>Opens a window containing multiple tabs. Each tab has
            information on a different aspect of the selected Sun SPOT,
            <i>e.g.</i>, installed applications, system properties, and
            energy/memory statistics.<br />

          <li><b>Set Name</b> 
            <p>The first time a SPOT displays in Solarium, the second half of
            its full IEEE numerical address is used as its name and displayed
            at the top of the SPOT image. This command allows you to specify a
            more meaningful name as a replacement. The name will be stored in
            persistent memory on the SPOT itself. </p>

            <p>Allows the user to turn on the SPOT's <a

            option is only enabled for USB-connected SPOTs that have their OTA
            command server turned off. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Reset</b> 
            <p>Resets the SPOT. It has the same effect as pressing the Control
            button. It will restart the master isolate. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Refresh</b> 
            <p>Queries the SPOT for its current list of installed and running
            applications and refreshes the display. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Remove</b> 
            <p>Removes this SPOT from the Solarium display. Removed SPOTs can
            be added again through the <a href="Discovery.html">SPOT
            discovery</a> process. </p>

      <td valign="top"><p>When debugging an application running on a network of
        SPOTs it can be quite helpful to be able to visualize the radio
        connectivity, i.e. which SPOTs can talk to each other. The Radio View
        provides a way for Solarium to discover and graphically depict the
        radio topology. Below is an example of a network of eight SPOTs and one
        basestation (shown in green). <br />
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="../gfx/RadioView.png" alt="Radio View example" height="auto"
        width="600" border="0" /> </center>

        <p>When the Radio View window is first opened, Solarium sends commands
        to each known SPOT asking it to discover its neighbors. The red lines
        show which SPOTs that can exchange radio packets. After all the SPOTs
        have replied a graphing algorithm is used to create the best layout
        that shows the radio topology. The Radio View has no knowledge of where
        the SPOTs are located physically, so the layout algorithm can only try
        to minimize the number of connections that cross each other. </p>

        <p>Since the radio topology can change over time, pushing the
        <b>Rediscover radio connections</b> button will cause Solarium to again
        ask each SPOT to discover its neighbors and then repeat the layout
        process. If the resulting layout is not clear enough, push the <b>Redo
        layout</b> button to try to find a better one. </p>

        <p>If you hover the mouse over a radio connection a tooltip will appear
        showing the link quality in each direction as measured by the two
        SPOTs. <br />
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="../gfx/RadioConnection.png" alt="Sample radio connection"
        height="auto" width="120" border="0" /> </center>

        <p>Link Quality is uniquely determined by the CORR value: CORR is a
        correlation measure provided directly by the radio part. Link Quality
        values range from 100% (the best, corresponding to a CORR value greater
        than 100) to 0% (the worst, which means the CORR value is less than
        50).</p>

        <p> </p>

        <p>The Radio View can also be used to show the route two SPOTs would
        use to talk to each other. Click on one of the SPOTs to bring up a
        pop-up menu where you can select the address of the SPOT to seek a
        route to. Below is the route from the basestation to 09F5. <br />
