           <p>
             In Java SE, an application consists of a static main()
             method defined in one of the loaded classes or it extends
             the Applet class if it is to run in a browser. In Java
             ME, an application is defined as a class that extends the
             MIDlet class. The Squawk VM used by Sun SPOTs implements
             Java ME, so all Sun SPOT applications extend the MIDlet
             class.
           </p>
           
           <p>
             In standard Java ME, only one application can be run at a
             time in a Java VM, though that application may consist of
             many threads. Squawk allows for multiple applications to
             be run together in a single SPOT and uses a special
             Isolate class to prevent one application from interfering
             with the execution of another. Each MIDlet-based
             application is run in a separate isolate. While one
             isolate cannot directly access the instances in another,
             they all share the same underlying SPOT resources.
           </p>
           
           <p>
             Some resources are unique, such as a radio connection on
             a specific port number. The first isolate to ask for that
             port will successfully be given access to it, while any
             subsequent requests from other isolates will fail. Other
             resources are truly shared such as the LEDs: One isolate
             might turn an LED on, and then another might turn it off
             or change its color.
           </p>
           
           <p>

             The isolate controlling the Sun SPOT at the system level
             is the master isolate. There is only one master isolate
             per SPOT. The master isolate controls the radio stack for
             the SPOT and access to the other components of the
             SPOT. Normally a SPOT application consists of a single
             MIDlet that is run in the master isolate.
           </p>
           
           <p>
             Solarium allows you to start and stop multiple MIDlets
             on a SPOT. These MIDlets are run as child isolates. Child
             isolates may suffer a slight performance penalty; for
             example, their radio transmissions have additional
             overhead because the child isolate must send requests to
             the master isolate to access the radio.
           </p>
           
           <p>
             Java ME allows you to package up several MIDlets into a
             single jar file. The MIDlets must all be listed in a
             special file, <tt>manifest.mf</tt>. The 
             <tt>manifest.mf</tt> file can be found in your project's
             <tt>resources/META-INF</tt> directory.Â
           </p>
           
           <p>
             When you add a new MIDlet to your project you must add a
             new line for it in the manifest file. If you use the SPOT
             modules for NetBeans, you can use the pop-up menu on the
             package (select the <b>New</b> -&gt; <b>File/Folder</b>
             command and then select “MIDlet Class” from “Java
             Classes”) to create the new MIDlet. NetBeans will
             automatically update the manifest file. NetBeans will
             also update the manifest if you rename an existing
             MIDlet.
           </p>
           
           <p>
             When the jar file is deployed to a Sun SPOT, all of the
             MIDlets are then available to be started from
             Solarium. One of them may be specified to be
             automatically run in the master isolate when the SPOT is
             rebooted. For now only one jar file may be deployed on a
             SPOT, but in the future it may be possible to deploy
             several.

             With this theoretical background in place, we will
             briefly go through an example of the creating of a jar
             file with two MIDlets. We will use two existing
             demonstration projects: the Bounce demo and the AirText
             demo. If you have worked your way through the Sun SPOT
             tutorial, as we strongly suggest, you will be familiar
             with these demos.
           </p>

           <p>
             Briefly, we will copy the classes from the Bounce demo
             and the AirText demo into a new project, then edit the
             manifest file. After that, we will compile the new jar
             file and it will be available to deploy to a Sun SPOT.
           </p>

                 Open NetBeans. Select the Project tab in the upper
                 left, and select the <i>BounceDemo-OnSPOT</i>
                 project. Right click on the project and
                 select <b>Copy Project</b>. <br/>

                 A dialog box will display allowing you to specify the
                 new project name. Here, we give it the name
                 ExampleJar. If we were to compile this project now,
                 we would get a jar file with one MIDlet in it, the
                 Bounce demo. Now we need to add the AirText demo to
                 the same project.

                 The format of the manifest file is <br/>
                 &lt;property-name&gt;:

               </p>

               <p>
                 The individual MIDlets are specified with property
                 names of “MIDlet-1”, “MIDlet-2” and so on. The
                 MIDlet property value is a string of three,
                 comma-separated, arguments. The first argument is a
                 name for the application, the second is intended to
                 define an icon, but is not used in Sun SPOTs, and the
                 third specifies the application’s main
                 class.
               </p>

               <p>
                 We will edit the manifest file to give it a new
                 MIDlet-name and tell it where to find the AirText
                 demo. We will also give the MIDlet descriptions some
                 user-friendly names.
               </p>
             </li>

             <li>
               <p>
                 Replace the MIDlet name with “Example Jar with two
                 MIDlets”. Edit the MIDlet-1 line to include the
                 phrase “Bounce Demo” between the colon and the
                 first comma. Add a second line, below it, that
                 reads:<br/>

                 <tt>MIDlet-2: Air Text Demo,,org.sunspotworld.demo.AirTextDemo</tt>
               </p>

               <p>
                 The manifest file should now read:<br/>
                 <tt>
                   MIDlet-Name: Example Jar with two MIDlets<br/>
                   MIDlet-Version: 1.0.0<br/>

                   MIDlet-2: Air Text Demo, ,org.sunspotworld.demo.AirTextDemo<br/>

               </p>

               <p>
                 Save the new version of the manifest file. If you
                 were to compile the project now, you would have a
                 single jar with two MIDlets in it. We can use that
                 jar file in Solarium.
