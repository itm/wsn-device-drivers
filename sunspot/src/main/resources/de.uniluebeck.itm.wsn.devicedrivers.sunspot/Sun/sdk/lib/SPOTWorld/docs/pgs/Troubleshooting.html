            If you're having trouble interacting with SPOTs,
            make sure that you can execute all of the basic
            commands outlined in the SPOT Developer's
            guide. There are command-line equivalents
            for most Solarium menu items (type <b>ant help</b>
            in a terminal window for a list of available commands).
            Make sure that these ant commands work properly.

            Here are some of the known issues in this release of Solarium.
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Emulator does not currently work if the file path
              where the Sun SPOT SDK has been installed includes an
              embedded space character. Windows users might especially
              encounter this problem as the standard installation
              location for Windows is C:\Program Files\. The current
              workaround is to install the SDK in a different location
              where none of the folders in the file path has a name
              with an embedded space character.
            </li>

            <li>
              Only simple applications can be paused/resumed or
              migrated from one SPOT to another because the current
              framework for saving and restoring an application's
              state is incomplete. In particular, applications with
              active network connections cannot be paused/resumed or 
              migrated properly.
            </li>
          </ul>
